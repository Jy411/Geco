# Geco
My Final Year Project

This project aims to encourage users to reduce their pollutant emissions by encouraging users to take more eco-friendly ways of travel. 

# How do we plan to achieve this?

The project aims to achieve this by offering a points-based reward system where users can earn points for moving around in eco-friendly ways such as taking the public transport, cycling, or walking. These points could then be redeemed at participating parties(stores, government organizations, and such) who wish to promote environmental causes.

Another functionality this project seeks to provide is providing the emissions generated from vehicles if they decide to travel from Point A to Point B with a car, or what-not. This functionality would try and calculate the CO2 emissions based on distance and vehicle CC, this is difficult since there are myriads of vehicles so the best we can do this is based on assumptions. 

We do not expect to be able to fully finish this project by the deadline, but this idea may be further worked on pass the project deadline as it may be beneficial to the environment as a whole; and may even pave the way for future works which could improve upon this idea. 

# Similar Ideas

There are many similar ideas with slightly different goals and functionalities already in development but there are none which have been mass-marketed to the general population. A simple Google search(or a search on Google Scholar) for research papers in the topic of eco-friendly mobility or smart mobility will provide many results, this area of research has been worked on before but is still in very early stages of development. There has been nothing full-scale to my knowledge.
